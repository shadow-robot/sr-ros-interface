# Examples

The sr_example package contains examples on how to use our hands from c++ or python code.

We're providing a [high level wrapper](sr_robot_commander) around our robots to make the interfacing easier for non-ROS people. You can find some examples showing you the different functionalities of the library in the [scripts/sr_example/commander folder](scripts/sr_example/commander).

For the full functionalities of the hand you can interface directly through the ROS interface. You'll find the python examples in the [scripts/sr_example folder](scripts/sr_example), and c++ examples in the [src folder](src).
