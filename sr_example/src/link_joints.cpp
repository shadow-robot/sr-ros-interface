 * @brief This is an example to show how to get data from the hand,
 * read the position for a specific joint and send this as the target to
 * another joint.
 *
 * This example can be tested with the simulated hand (or simulated hand and arm)
 * by using the following commands in separate terminals
 * * \verbatim
 * roslaunch sr_hand  gazebo_arm_and_hand.launch
 * or
 * roslaunch sr_hand  gazebo_hand.launch
 * and then
 * rosrun sr_example link_joints
 * rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui
 \endverbatim
 * in the rqt_gui go to plugins->ShadowRobot->joint slider and select EtherCAT hand
 * If you move the joint slider for FFJ3, then MFJ3 will move as well.
 *
