# This demo is a simple script that reads data from the tactile sensors in the finger tips and does some actions in response.
# This version can work with PST tactiles and (with a modification in the subscriber topic name) with Biotac sensors
# When a finger tip is pressed and the value of the pressure exceeds a predefined threshold an action is triggered
# There is a different action defined for each finger. Actions involve one of the following things:
# - send a predefined pose command to the hand
# - send a predefined pose command to the arm (if there is not an arm the arm commands will be ignored)
# - the PC beeps (you should install the beep (sudo apt-get install beep)
