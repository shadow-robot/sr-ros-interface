Joint to actuator mappings
==========================

Contains the different mapping files for joint to motor/muscle.

The mapping for a particular hand should be specified in the hand launch
file in
`sr\_config <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr-config/tree/indigo-devel/sr_ethercat_hand_config/launch>`__.

The use of an incorrect mapping could cause damage to the hand. If you
are uncertain as to which mapping file should be used for your hand,
please contact production@shadowrobot.com.
