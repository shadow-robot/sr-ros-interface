    <description>
      This transmission is used to control the theoretical joint 0s in our hand: the joint 0 is the combination of the joint 1 (distal) and joint 2 (middle). Those 2 joints are controlled by one actuator only but have a sensor each.

    <description>
      This transmission is used to control the theoretical joint 0s in our hand: the joint 0 is the combination of the joint 1 (distal) and joint 2 (middle). Those 2 joints are controlled by one actuator only but have a sensor each. On the Biotac hand, joint 1 is fixed to 20.0 degrees.
