In addition to the gtest test_sr_description_urdf which tests xacro expansion and resulting urdf validity, 
visual tests have been added to check the generated urdf produce the desired hand with correct joints.
The visual tests are shell script and require user interaction
1) start the test
  /bin/bash tests_hand.sh for all the hand models (no arm)
  or 
  /bin/bash tests.sh for arm and hand models

you will see 
 press enter after you tested and killed the launch file
 Press [Enter] key

2) User is requested to press enter the first time and each time after a visual inspection is over
3) To finish an inspection do a CTRL-C in the terminal 
   Goto 2)

Currently there is no way to select the test, if one fails, fix the urdf, and re-run all the visual inspections
