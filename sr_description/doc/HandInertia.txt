work done during the HANDLE project in 2011 (inertia tensor moved to joint axis)
reworked 2015 (inertia tensor at COM)

Overview
========

Hand inertia estimated from bounding box or bounding cylinders.
mass estimated from volume of bounding boxes times density of material 
  (sometimes adjusted to match real values)
computation done with octave


Octave functions 
================

---------------
function [ix,iy,iz] = inertiabox(sx,sy,sz,mass)

ix = 1/12.0*mass*(sy*sy+sz*sz);
iy = 1/12.0*mass*(sx*sx+sz*sz);
iz = 1/12.0*mass*(sy*sy+sx*sx);
end
---------------
function [ix,iy,iz] = inertiacyl(radius,length,mass)
% along z

iz = mass* radius*radius/2;
ix = 1/12.0* mass * (3*radius*radius+length*length);
iy = ix;
end
