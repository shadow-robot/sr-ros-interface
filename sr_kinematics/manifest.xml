  <description brief="A specific shadowhand package for computing finger Kinematics derived from arm_kinematics">
    A specific shadowhand package derived from arm_kinematics, for computing both forward and backward kinematics for the fingers except thumb.
    Solution is analytic. Developed as an alternative to arm_kinematics that cannot solve coupled joints.
